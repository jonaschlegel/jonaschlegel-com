# Exploring Women in Archaeology Through Cover Design

As an archaeological illustrator interested in representation within the field, I developed a cover design concept that explores women's contributions to archaeology across different time periods. This personal project allowed me to examine how archaeological practice and women's roles within the discipline have evolved whilst experimenting with visual storytelling techniques.

The concept features three female archaeologists representing past, present, and future—each embodying the tools and methodologies of their era. The past figure carries traditional excavation equipment, the present-day archaeologist operates a FARO laser scanner, and the future archaeologist hints at technologies yet to come. This temporal progression provided a framework for exploring both technological advancement and changing professional opportunities.

## Design Development

Creating this illustration required balancing historical accuracy with visual cohesion:

I wanted to capture authentic archaeological work without resorting to stereotypical imagery. Archaeological practice demands precision, physical endurance, and intellectual rigour—qualities I aimed to convey through careful attention to posture, equipment, and working environments.

The challenge involved representing different time periods accurately whilst maintaining visual unity. I researched historical photographs of female archaeologists, from early pioneers like Dorothy Garrod to contemporary field leaders, studying their clothing, equipment, and working contexts. For the futuristic element, I extrapolated from current technological trends in archaeological survey and documentation.

## Research and Historical Context

Women have shaped archaeology since its early development, yet their contributions often remain underacknowledged in mainstream historical narratives. This design concept offered an opportunity to address that gap through visual representation.

I studied the evolution of fieldwork practices, noting how technology has transformed archaeological investigation whilst fundamental research questions remain constant. The laser scanner represents current practice, but also symbolises how women now lead technological innovation in the field—a significant shift from earlier periods when access to cutting-edge equipment was often restricted.

The composition deliberately avoids hierarchical positioning. Rather than arranging figures in a linear timeline, I positioned them as colleagues engaged in related work, suggesting continuity and collaboration across generations.

## Visual Communication Approach

Academic and popular archaeology publications require covers that work across multiple contexts—digital platforms, print displays, and conference materials. I designed with these varied applications in mind, ensuring the illustration remains legible and impactful at different scales.

The colour palette draws from earth tones associated with archaeological sites, whilst incorporating technological blues to represent innovation. This creates visual unity whilst allowing each time period to maintain distinct characteristics that reflect their respective eras.

The illustration style balances professional representation with accessible visual language, making archaeological work approachable whilst maintaining respect for the discipline's complexity and rigour.

## Intended Audiences

This design concept addresses several overlapping communities within archaeology and beyond:

**Archaeological professionals** seeking recognition of women's contributions to the discipline can find representation and inspiration. The accurate depiction of tools and methodologies demonstrates respect for professional expertise whilst celebrating historical progress.

**Students and early-career researchers** can see themselves reflected in the contemporary and future figures, understanding archaeology as a field where they can lead and innovate rather than simply participate.

**Public audiences** interested in archaeology but unfamiliar with women's roles in the field encounter an accessible entry point that challenges common preconceptions whilst maintaining scholarly credibility.

## Technical Execution

The week-long development process required efficient workflow whilst maintaining attention to detail. I used digital illustration techniques in Procreate, allowing for rapid iteration whilst preserving the hand-drawn quality that humanises the figures and makes them relatable.

The composition needed to work effectively as a standalone illustration whilst suggesting potential applications in editorial contexts. This flexibility enables the design to serve multiple purposes from portfolio presentation to educational material development.

## Project Reflection

This project reinforced my interest in how visual communication can address representation gaps in archaeology. While academic writing reaches specialist audiences, images can influence broader perceptions about who belongs in archaeological work and what that work involves.

The design process highlighted the importance of historical research in contemporary illustration. Understanding how women's roles in archaeology have actually evolved—rather than how they're commonly perceived—proved essential for creating authentic rather than stereotypical representations.

Working on this concept strengthened my commitment to projects that advance archaeological understanding whilst addressing ongoing challenges around diversity and inclusion in the field.
