<h3>Adventuress Archaeology Journal – Cover Design</h3>

This cover illustration was created for the inaugural issue of **Adventuress Archaeology**, a journal dedicated to exploring the role of women in archaeology across the past, present, and future. The artwork symbolises the evolution of female archaeologists through different periods, blending historical accuracy with a vision for the future. The cover features three female archaeologists: one from the past, one representing the present, and a potential futuristic archaeologist, each depicting their respective time periods and methodologies, including modern technologies such as the FARO laser scanner.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- **Visually capture** the journey of women in archaeology through time, showing how their roles and contributions have evolved.
- Highlight the **advancements in technology** and fieldwork practices within archaeology, particularly focusing on the increasing presence of women in this historically male-dominated field.
- Provide a **representative and empowering image** that resonates with women in archaeology, both in academic circles and the broader public.

## Challenges

This project presented several challenges:

- **Historical and Futuristic Accuracy**: It was important to ensure the accurate representation of archaeological tools and clothing across different time periods, from the early 20th century to a speculative future.
- **Artistic and Professional Balance**: The cover had to maintain a professional tone fitting for an academic journal while also embracing a creative, illustrative style that would attract readers and represent the theme effectively.
- **Symbolism**: The illustration needed to blend historical elements with a futuristic outlook, while still being clear and recognisable as an archaeological-themed cover.

## Target Group & Pain Points

The **Adventuress Archaeology Journal** is aimed at:

- **Archaeologists**, especially women, seeking representation and visibility in their field. Women's contributions have often been overlooked or marginalised in both historical and academic contexts, and this cover serves as a powerful image to inspire future generations.
- **Researchers** and **students** interested in the evolution of archaeological practices, particularly in how women have shaped the discipline.
- **General readers** who are curious about the progression of archaeology and the tools and methods used over time.

By combining images of past, present, and future female archaeologists, this cover design aims to highlight not only the changes in technology and methodology but also the growing recognition and impact of women in archaeology.

## Project Details

- **Length**: 1 week (September 2024)
- **Institute**: Adventuress Archaeology (Journal publication)
- **Tools**: Procreate, digital illustration techniques
- **Year**: 2024
