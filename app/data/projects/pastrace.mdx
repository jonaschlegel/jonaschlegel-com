# Logo Design for 3D Heritage Documentation

I designed the visual identity for **PasTrace**, a German company specialising in photogrammetry and 3D documentation of cultural heritage sites. The project involved creating a logo that would work across digital platforms whilst communicating both technical precision and respect for cultural preservation.

PasTrace documents everything from small archaeological objects to large monuments, creating detailed 3D models for research and preservation purposes. Their work appears on platforms like Sketchfab and serves museums, researchers, and heritage institutions across Europe.

## Design Approach

The logo uses a geometric diamond form that references both the 3D nature of their scanning work and the precision required for photogrammetry. The angular structure suggests the point clouds and mesh geometries fundamental to 3D reconstruction.

I chose red as the primary colour to distinguish PasTrace from the blues and grays common in technology branding. The red works well against the neutral backgrounds typical of 3D model viewing platforms and provides strong brand recognition.

## Logo Variations and Applications

The identity system includes several variations to accommodate different uses:

The standalone symbol works for social media profiles and small applications where space is limited. The full wordmark provides complete brand identification for professional presentations and technical documentation.

A version with the tagline "high-fidelity digital realities" explains the company's focus for audiences unfamiliar with photogrammetry services.

## Technical Considerations

The logo needed to function effectively on digital platforms where PasTrace showcases their 3D models. This required clear visibility against varied backgrounds and crisp rendering at different scales.

The vector-based construction ensures the logo maintains sharp edges across all applications, from Sketchfab profile images to conference presentations. The geometric form scales well whilst the red colour provides consistent brand recognition.

## Project Context

This project helped me understand how visual identity functions within specialised technical communities. The logo needed to appeal to heritage professionals who value cultural sensitivity alongside technology partners who require confidence in technical capabilities.

Working with PasTrace expanded my knowledge of digital heritage workflows and the importance of creating brand systems that support rather than compete with complex technical content.
