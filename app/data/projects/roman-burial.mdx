# Roman Mother-Daughter Burial Reconstruction

In 2004, archaeologists discovered an unusual burial in the eastern cemetery of Ovilava (modern-day Wels, Austria) that would challenge initial interpretations and reveal new insights about Roman burial practices. Twenty years later, I was commissioned to create a scientific illustration for the comprehensive study that would finally identify this remarkable find: the first genetically documented mother-daughter burial from Roman period Austria.

The burial immediately struck excavators as extraordinary. Two individuals lay with one having an arm around the other, positioned directly above complete horse skeletal remains in the same burial pit. Initial assessments suggested a mixed-sex pair buried with a horse, potentially dating to the early medieval period based on the equine burial tradition.

## Scientific Revelation Through Interdisciplinary Analysis

The research team's comprehensive study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, employed multiple scientific techniques that dramatically revised these initial interpretations. Radiocarbon dating placed both human and horse remains firmly in the Roman period, challenging assumptions about horse burial traditions in this era.

Ancient DNA analysis provided the most surprising revelation: both individuals were biological females with a first-degree kinship relationship. The age difference of 15-25 years between them suggested a probable mother-daughter relationship, making this the first genetically confirmed case of its kind in Roman Austria.

My illustration needed to reflect these scientific findings accurately whilst conveying the emotional significance of this family burial. The challenge involved representing the specific positioning documented during excavation whilst respecting the newly understood relationships between the individuals.

## Collaborative Reconstruction Process

Working with the interdisciplinary research team required careful attention to their published findings and methodological approaches. The study combined bioarchaeological analysis, radiocarbon dating, and ancient DNA techniques—each contributing essential data that informed the reconstruction.

I studied the original excavation documentation alongside the new scientific results, ensuring the illustration reflected both the physical evidence and the updated understanding of the burial's significance. The positioning of the individuals—one with an arm around the other—took on new meaning in light of the genetic evidence revealing their family relationship.

The horse burial required particular attention to anatomical accuracy and spatial relationships. The equine remains lay directly below the human burial, an arrangement that needed clear visual representation to support the research team's analysis of this unusual Roman-period practice.

## Illustration for Scientific Publication

The reconstruction supported the research team's publication in a peer-reviewed archaeological journal, requiring standards appropriate for academic audiences. The illustration needed to clarify spatial relationships between human and horse remains whilst presenting the new understanding of the individuals' identities and relationships.

I ensured the visual reconstruction reflected the conservative approach taken by the research team, showing only what could be supported by archaeological evidence and scientific analysis. Details about clothing, positioning, and environmental context remained grounded in documented Roman burial practices from comparable sites.

The illustration accompanied the scientific paper as part of a comprehensive interdisciplinary study that demonstrated how modern techniques can revise historical interpretations. The visual component helped communicate complex spatial and temporal relationships that text descriptions alone couldn't convey effectively.

## Impact on Roman Archaeological Understanding

This burial represents a rare example of combined human-horse interment from Roman antiquity, challenging previous assumptions about the chronological distribution of such practices. The genetic confirmation of the mother-daughter relationship adds emotional and social dimensions to our understanding of Roman burial customs.

The research demonstrates how scientific techniques can reveal stories invisible to traditional archaeological methods. What appeared to be a male-female burial pair proved to be something more specific and poignant—a family burial that speaks to enduring bonds between mother and daughter.

The study contributes to broader understanding of Roman burial practices, particularly regarding family relationships and the inclusion of horses in funeral rites. The Ovilava cemetery continues to yield insights about provincial Roman communities and their cultural practices.

## Documentation and Preservation

The illustration serves multiple purposes within the research framework: supporting academic publication, enabling museum display, and facilitating educational outreach about Roman archaeological science. The visual documentation preserves interpretive understanding for future reference and study.

The interdisciplinary approach taken by the research team—combining traditional archaeological methods with advanced scientific techniques—provides a model for investigating complex burial contexts. My illustration captures this collaborative methodology whilst making the findings accessible to diverse audiences.

## Reflection on Scientific Illustration

Working on this project reinforced the importance of evidence-based reconstruction in archaeological illustration. Initial interpretations, however reasonable, can be dramatically revised by scientific analysis, requiring illustrators to remain flexible and responsive to new findings.

The project demonstrated how visual communication can support complex interdisciplinary research, helping diverse specialists communicate their findings effectively. The illustration serves as a synthesis tool that integrates multiple lines of evidence into coherent visual interpretation.

Most importantly, the work reminds us that archaeological finds represent real people with real relationships. The mother-daughter identification transforms this burial from an academic curiosity into a human story about family bonds that transcended death in Roman society.
