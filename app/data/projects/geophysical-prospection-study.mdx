# Geophysical Survey at Müstair UNESCO World Heritage Site

As part of a collaborative research project coordinated by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology (LBI ArchPro), I conducted comprehensive geophysical investigations at the medieval monastery of Müstair in Switzerland. This UNESCO World Heritage Site, founded around AD 780, preserves exceptional Carolingian architecture and frescoes, but the extent of the broader monastic complex remained unknown.

As first author of the resulting study published in [Remote Sensing (MDPI)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/13/2515), my primary contributions focused on data processing, archaeological interpretation, and cartographic visualization of the geophysical survey results. Working within the strict conservation protocols required for UNESCO heritage sites, we employed magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar to map subsurface archaeological features without excavation.

## Research Context and Methodology

The investigation aimed to understand the spatial organization of the medieval monastic complex beyond the preserved architectural remains. Working within the project framework established by LBI ArchPro and site authorities, the geophysical survey employed high-resolution magnetometry and multi-frequency ground-penetrating radar across selected areas of the monastery grounds.

The survey strategy balanced comprehensive coverage with heritage protection requirements. Magnetometry data were collected using caesium vapour sensors achieving sub-metre spatial resolution, while GPR employed 400 MHz and 800 MHz antennas to investigate different depth ranges and feature types within the complex subsurface environment.

## Data Processing and Interpretation

The geophysical datasets required specialized processing to extract archaeological information. Magnetometry data underwent gradient calculation, noise reduction, and enhancement filtering to resolve subtle anomalies. Ground-penetrating radar processing included dewow, gain correction, and depth migration to produce interpretable subsurface images.

Feature interpretation involved systematic analysis of anomaly characteristics, spatial patterns, and intensity distributions. Linear features suggested structural remains, while discrete anomalies indicated potential activity areas. The analysis integrated geophysical results with historical documentation and architectural knowledge to develop coherent interpretations of subsurface archaeology.

## Cartographic Visualization

The project developed specialized mapping approaches to integrate geophysical results with architectural and historical documentation. Visualization strategies combined survey data with topographical context and historical cartography, creating layered interpretations accessible to heritage professionals and researchers.

Three-dimensional data integration proved particularly valuable for understanding spatial relationships within the medieval complex. Depth-slice analysis of GPR data combined with magnetic intensity mapping provided volumetric representations of subsurface features, supporting interpretation of building layouts and activity areas.

## Survey Results

The investigation revealed subsurface features extending beyond the visible monastery buildings. Magnetometry identified linear anomalies suggesting structural foundations, while GPR detected building remains and activity areas. Notable discoveries included a large rectangular structure northeast of the main buildings, potentially representing guest quarters or administrative facilities mentioned in historical sources.

Agricultural infrastructure appeared as linear features throughout the survey area, indicating water management systems and field boundaries that supported the medieval monastic economy. Discrete magnetic anomalies suggested locations of craft production areas, including metalworking and ceramic production facilities.

## Technical Innovation and Results

The research advanced non-invasive heritage investigation through integrated magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar analysis. Statistical classification techniques distinguished archaeological features from geological variation, while correlation protocols validated interpretations across different geophysical datasets.

Quality assurance procedures included systematic inter-method comparison and confidence assessment metrics for anomaly interpretation. The methodology provides reproducible frameworks for heritage site investigation while maintaining conservation compliance.

## Publication and Impact

Results were published as the lead article in [Remote Sensing (MDPI)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/13/2515), focusing on the technical integration of geophysical methods within UNESCO heritage contexts. The open-access publication has informed subsequent heritage management projects across Europe, establishing protocols for non-invasive investigation at protected archaeological sites.
