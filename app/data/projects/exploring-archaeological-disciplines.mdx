  'Exploring Archaeological Disciplines – A Comic-Style Illustration Series';

# Breaking Archaeological Stereotypes Through Comics

"So you study old pots, then?" This question follows me everywhere—at dinner parties, on planes, whenever archaeology comes up in conversation. Whilst pottery analysis forms part of archaeological work, the discipline encompasses far more than most people realise. I created this comic-style illustration series to challenge these narrow perceptions and reveal archaeology's true interdisciplinary nature.

The idea emerged during a particularly frustrating social media scroll, where yet another "archaeology equals treasure hunting" meme had gone viral. Instead of feeling annoyed, I decided to respond constructively. Comics offered the perfect medium—engaging enough to capture attention whilst allowing space for genuine education.

## Choosing the Comic Format

Comics work because they mirror how we naturally process complex information. Just as archaeologists piece together fragments to build narratives, comic readers connect panels to understand stories. The format also removes barriers that academic writing can create, inviting readers to explore subjects they might otherwise find intimidating.

I wanted each illustration to feel authentic rather than cartoonish. Real archaeological work requires precision, creativity, and often uncomfortable working conditions—qualities I aimed to capture through character expressions and environmental details. The challenge lay in balancing accuracy with accessibility, ensuring each discipline remained recognisable to practitioners whilst remaining comprehensible to newcomers.

## Selecting Archaeological Specialisms

Choosing which disciplines to feature required careful consideration. I prioritised fields that challenged common assumptions about archaeological practice whilst representing genuine career paths for current students.

**Archaeobotany** showcases archaeology's scientific foundations. Many people don't realise that understanding ancient agriculture requires laboratory analysis, microscopy, and botanical expertise. I illustrated an archaeobotanist examining carbonised seeds, surrounded by the tools and knowledge systems this work demands.

**Forensic archaeology** demonstrates archaeology's contemporary relevance. These practitioners apply excavation skills to modern investigations, working with law enforcement and human rights organisations. The illustration shows the careful, systematic approach that distinguishes archaeological method from general investigation techniques.

**Kurgan archaeology** represents regional specialisms that require linguistic, cultural, and landscape expertise. These burial mounds across Eurasia tell complex stories about migration, social organisation, and belief systems—stories that emerge only through interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Jōmon archaeology** highlights how archaeological focus can span millennia within specific cultural contexts. Japanese Jōmon pottery represents some of humanity's earliest ceramic traditions, requiring specialists who understand both technological development and cultural continuity.

## Design Decisions

Each illustration follows consistent visual principles whilst allowing individual personality. I used earthy colour palettes that reference archaeological contexts—ochres, burnt siennas, and muted greens that evoke both landscapes and laboratory environments.

Character design proved crucial. Rather than creating generic figures, I researched actual practitioners in each field, studying their working environments, equipment, and methodological approaches. This research ensured authenticity whilst avoiding stereotypical representations.

Typography choices reinforce the educational purpose. Clear, readable fonts ensure accessibility, whilst hand-lettered elements add personality and maintain connection to the handmade quality that characterises much archaeological documentation.

## Audience Engagement

Social media distribution shaped both content and format. Instagram's visual-first approach suits comic illustration, but the platform's rapid scroll demands immediate impact. Each illustration needed to work as both standalone content and part of a cohesive series.

Comments and shares revealed unexpected audience diversity. Established archaeologists appreciated seeing their specialisms represented accurately, whilst students found the series helpful for understanding career possibilities. Parents shared the illustrations with children interested in history, and other science communicators requested similar approaches for their own disciplines.

The series also sparked conversations about representation within archaeology. Several followers pointed out the importance of showing diverse practitioners, leading to ongoing discussions about inclusivity in archaeological communication.

## Educational Applications

Teachers began incorporating the illustrations into lesson plans, using them to introduce archaeological thinking before exploring specific historical periods. The visual format helps students understand that archaeology involves active investigation rather than passive discovery.

Museum educators found the series useful for explaining why archaeological interpretation requires specialist knowledge. Visitors often assume that artefact meanings are self-evident, but these illustrations demonstrate the training and expertise that informed interpretation requires.

## Professional Recognition

Archaeological societies shared the series across their networks, appreciating content that accurately represented their work to broader audiences. This professional endorsement validated the approach whilst extending reach within archaeological communities.

Conference presentations about the project generated discussions about science communication responsibilities. Many colleagues expressed frustration with public misunderstanding of their work but felt unsure how to address it effectively. These conversations highlighted the need for more accessible archaeological communication.

## Future Development

The series continues evolving as I discover new specialisms and refine my approach. Recent additions include environmental archaeology, digital archaeology, and experimental archaeology—fields that further challenge traditional perceptions.

I'm exploring interactive versions that could link illustrations to deeper content, allowing interested viewers to explore specific disciplines more thoroughly. Educational partnerships might enable curriculum integration, whilst professional collaborations could ensure continued accuracy and relevance.

## Reflection on Impact

This project reinforced my belief that effective science communication requires genuine understanding of both subject matter and audience needs. Comics work because they respect both complexity and curiosity, offering pathways into difficult subjects without oversimplification.

Most importantly, the series demonstrates that archaeological knowledge deserves broader understanding. Our investigations into human pasts offer insights relevant to contemporary challenges—insights that remain valuable only when effectively shared.
